You cannot resist returning to this place; I know that the memories of that night still conjure nightmares in your sleep. The face you saw, that is the price one pays for learning the truth. Truth which you deny!{^n}{^n}Do you remember how we used to play around the old ruins as children? Father always told us not to, that we would be swept away by the harpies that fill the sky in the twilight hours. But what if he was not just trying to protect us? Perhaps there were ulterior motives to keeping us away from the old places of the world? What if, should we venture inside, we would learn more about his past than he wished for us to know?{^n}{^n}I have done what you could not, Daila.

The stones screamed with unfettered rage, rage towards...me. Do the dead despise the living so? Do they yearn after what was stolen from them? To exist in such a state of endless limbo would drive any soul mad, but I do not believe that madness is what inspired this response. There was something familiar within these stones.{^n}{^n}I have to learn more. So I intend to visit the one place I know our father had been: our childhood home.

Despite our father's efforts, I was able to rescue some pages from the inferno. He told us that our mother died in childbirth, that much is true, but what you do not know is that we were not the first.

It has taken him a thousand-thousand souls trapped within a single moment of agony to accomplish this impossible deed. What dark day in history served in the pursuit of immortality, I cannot say. But here, in the Necropolis, our father prepared a different ritual. This one was meant to harvest what remained of the tormented dead within the grave site, to replenish his own shattered being, but for whatever reason he never finished it. The sigil was abandoned. All that remained was to light the pyre and offer a living sacrifice.{^n}{^n}Without hesitation, I finished what he could not.

Thus, I cast the dice and raced toward the heart of Erulan, trying to conceal myself as best I could.{^n}{^n}Upon my arrival, I proceeded cautiously, booking a room at a squalid inn near the west gates in an effort to keep my arrival secret. Initially I sought out old acquaintances, assuming if I could detect some change in personality or behavior, it might reveal possession. A few awkward reunions made it painfully obvious that years on the road carrying out my duties as an inquisitor had left me out of touch and unable to discern whether any changes were the result of possession, or just the passage of time and faded memories.

I had never stirred such controversy but I always imagined, if such an encounter took place, I could put up a respectable fight. I never got the chance. Taken unawares, I was disarmed before I even knew what was happening. Had he sought my death, I would not have even witnessed the killing stroke fall. However, he seemed more interested in answers instead and, in turn, provided me with an account of his own events that confirmed my worst fears.{^n}{^n}The First Blade revealed that, only days prior, he had been forced to turn his knives on the Emperor himself, by his own command. Despite the myriad safeguards protecting the Emperor, both mundane and arcane, he had become host to an Aetherial. Through strength of mind, he had usurped his possessor long enough to summon the First Blade, command his own execution and charge the assassin with ensuring that his son, the young prince, survive to reclaim the throne.{^n}{^n}His last commands issued, the Emperor's consciousness slipped once again under the control of the Aetherial and a desperate battle ensued. The First Blade reported that he believed the Emperor and the Aetherial within him slain but, given his inexperience with the entities, could not say anything for certain. He relayed that he had secretly taken the prince and put him into hiding but declined to elaborate. The First Blade said he intended to retire his imperial title and had chosen the name Ulgrim, which made me curious as to whether it was an intentional reference to the mythic character.{^n}{^n}A final troubling detail was that no proclamation of the Emperor's passing had been issued. Not only did this demonstrate the Aetherials had sufficient control of the palace to conceal the death but, given that they couldn't hope to hide the Emperor's absence for long, it suggested the next phase of their operation was imminent.{^n}{^n}I strategized with Ulgrim long into the night, formulating a plan to counter the Aetherials, but ultimately we agreed that we could not defeat their conspiracy in time. The only course left was gather whatever people and resources we could, go to ground and weather the coming storm; then find a way to counter the invaders.{^n}{^n}We agreed that the Black Legion would be our best hope in securing allies. As a conscripted army of criminals, debtors and political dissidents bound to service, it seemed unlikely that the Aetherials would have any reason to infiltrate them when they could control them indirectly through the military high command.

  "TagLoreObj_OldArkovia_History01Text": "As I write this, dark columns of smoke billow up from the port where the madness long pullulating in the restive populace has finally boiled over. A blazing merchant's galley, abandoned by its crew and freed of its moorings plows into a group of fishing boats, wood splintering, the fire quickly spreading among the sails. I hear shouting in the courtyard below and the clash of iron not far beyond; a woman screams repeatedly, her words indiscernible.{^n}{^n}For so long, we feared our doom would come from the barbarous mountain tribes but in the end, we've been the instruments of our own demise; helped along by the insidious promises of the necromancers.{^n}{^n}It is not yet two moons since the great rituals were undertaken, led by our ever reaching Oligarchs; the rituals intended to bring immortality and ensure the lasting greatness of Arkovia. Ever the skeptic, I figured it for a sham; political theatre at best, but the ritual seems to have been a tragic success.{^n}{^n}This ritual was the invention of a necromancer named Uroboruuk. A man imprisoned in the Steps of Torment, who it is said did not age and could not be killed by any means. The leaders of the three greatest houses, including my own patron, Laudos Vagra, made an ill-conceived journey to the tower in hopes of compelling this Uroboruuk to give up his secrets. Here, immortality worked against Uroboruuk as he was subjected to the most brutal and imaginative forms of torture that could be devised for a man who could not die. Finally, Uroboruuk agreed to instruct them in the ritual and the Oligarchs, blinded by their lust for immortality, were all too eager to believe his will broken and accepted the ritual as genuine.{^n}{^n}It has become clear that the people of Arkovia have indeed gained a form of immortality but it is a cruel and twisted fulfillment of that promise. Our bodies still suffer the ravages of time, eventually dying and decaying, whilst our spirits remain trapped within, eternally bound to this land.{^n}{^n}I have witnessed this myself as the sick and elderly, near death at the time of the ritual, remain with us yet. Their bodies visibly decay, in the manner of a corpse, yet they continue on as though living, able to move and talk; still much the same persons as they were in life, yet not.{^n}{^n}All who suffer this death of the body become somehow less vital, less dynamic of thought. They become ever more narrowly focused on whatever concerned them most in life. It is disturbing to witness families that do not know what to do with their deceased, yet still present, loved ones.{^n}{^n}More horrible still are the rumors of babies born since the ritual. Abominations they say, deformed and bearing dark grisly feathers. It is said that many forlorn new fathers have been seen trekking into the broken hills, bundle in arm, to leave their unnatural offspring to the elements.{^n}{^n}The din of fighting and wailing continues on below. I expect it shall for quite some time since the combatants cannot die by any mortal means. I will sit with my books and continue my writing for whatever time may remain... perhaps all eternity...{^n}{^n}Theodokus Vagra, Scribe of Arkovia",

  "tagLoreObj_Cronley_NoteA04Text": "It falls upon strange times that a king would abdicate the throne of his own volition. Stranger still is the reason he gave his court. There is no other way to put it. King Rhowan, the third of his line, had been struck by madness. Upon returning from a successful campaign against the barbarian tribes of Agarond's Peak, the King raved about a chance meeting with a weary traveler whom he called Mogdrogen. Rhowan, in his generosity, offered the old man the use of his horse. The man, and here is where the King's tale loses all sense, declined the proposal and, speaking in a low voice that only his Majesty could hear, instead offered Rhowan a warning.{^n}{^n}The old man spurted prophetic lies about the impending collapse of our great nation and the fall of the beacon of the west, Arkovia herself. He implored the King to leave his title, his wealth, his very identity behind. There were some amongst the court who urged Rhowan to see his madness through, greedy heads of Arkovian Houses who saw this tragedy as an opportunity to seize power. The Queen, the shining jewel of Arkovia, wept before her King and begged him to reconsider; but Rhowan was resolute. With a single decree, he shattered the royal line and abandoned his ordained post as King of Arkovia. Word of the King's madness spread quickly among the populace. To my great surprise, some of his subjects followed Rhowan's lead, abandoning their livelihoods to follow their despondent ruler into a life of poverty and lost identity.{^n}{^n}It has been three fortnights since that fateful day. The queen lies dead in her chambers. They say she had died of sorrow, from the loss of her King, but I suspect more clandestine causes. The court has fallen into chaos as the great Houses bicker amongst themselves for the empty throne. With no end in sight to the squabbles and no clear line to the throne, my patron, Laudos Vagra, has called for the formation of an Oligarchy, ruled by the heads of Arkovia's elite.{^n}{^n}No good can come of this. Of that I am certain. These days, I cannot help but wonder if Rhowan's prophecy was a self-fulfilling one. Or perhaps this storm was a longtime coming and we were merely too blind to see it.

A deep sense of dread immediately overcame her.{^n}{^n}\"I knew you'd come out to greet me, Daila my dear,\" a ghastly voice spoke from behind the tree.

Murder was my trade, the shadows my refuge. I truly believed that was all life had in store for me. But then I found happiness, I found you. Through you, I learned the joys of life, that there is more to me than a blade in the shadows. It was better than I ever deserved, but my old life came at a price. I made many powerful enemies. Enemies I cannot protect you from.{^n}{^n}Some men from my past dealings have come forward with an offer to hide us from those that would seek to harm you in order to get at me, if I do one last job for them. I cannot allow you to become a victim of my former self, so I must ask your forgiveness. I have to do something I swore to you that I would never do again.{^n}{^n}I am writing this letter because I have agreed to take on a very dangerous task. It will ensure your safety. Take the money I have left with this note. Use it to get out of the city and far from here. Do not tell anyone where you are going. If I succeed, I will find you. But if you never hear from me again I want you to live your life and know that you were the only light in my dark. Knowing that I've kept you safe is the only reward I need.{^n}{^n}All my love,{^n}{^n}Keval",

Our business is thriving and Alden was hopeful to get a second shop opened up in high town by this time next year. But he came home from the court disappointed. Apparently the mayor has been denying all requests for an audience and his newly appointed High Advisor dismissed Alden's appeal for a deed without even hearing his case.{^n}{^n}Now there's the mess with the garbage spilling out of the old dumping ground. Everyone I've asked doesn't seem to know anything about why trash has been redirected to the already full dump in our district. The new curfew also hasn't been kind to business as we've had to close down early each night.{^n}{^n}Omeer and Shara are both terrified.

I stifled a scream of my own and quickly ran back downstairs.{^n}{^n}All the commotion had caused my husband to stir and he stood up for the first time in days. But his eyes were glazed over and dull and his movements like the people outside. His skin was chalk white and his chest did not move with the rhythmic breathing of the living. Hands shaking, I grabbed the revolver he gave me and pointed it at his head. He did not talk; he did not even try to move out of the way. He just kept approaching me in a slow unsteady gait. At that moment I understood what wandered the streets outside and I clenched my tear-swollen eyes as I pulled the trigger.{^n}{^n}I can't sleep anymore. My husband's body lies next to me, a hole in his skull. There is nothing left for me here. It's time to go before no hope of escape remains, before my strength has left me.

This would have been an excellent weakness to exploit, but his outward persona is a mask that masterfully concealed a very sharp mind. Evidently, this is part of his political strategy and has led many an adversary to underestimate him.{^n}{^n}Although my efforts have proven futile, they were not entirely without success for I have found my way into the mind of the mayor's trusted advisor who they call Van Aldritch.

He belongs to us now.{^n}{^n}This vessel has many valuable connections within the city, which I had used to orchestrate assassination attempts upon the mayor. While those too proved unsuccessful, they have caused the mayor to become increasingly paranoid and fearful for his wellbeing. As a direct approach seems to be out of the question, I have begun stirring the locals in the interest of destabilizing the region. To facilitate matters, I've used my position to subtly push the mayor's decisions in the direction that suits us so that the growing dissent goes unnoticed until it is far too late.{^n}{^n}While this is contrary to our usual methods, I am confident that Port Valbury will be ready for the imminent Glorious Dawn and no adjustments will be necessary to our established timeline.{^n}{^n}-Van Aldritch, High Advisor of Port Valbury",

You have taken your first step along the way to the deeper truths, as countless brothers and sisters have before you. The path now presented to you is a treacherous one. You will be persecuted for your practices, hunted like a rodent by the empire's Luminari hounds; but to persevere, to endure the trials that our patron Lords have endured, that is the way to true power through the eldritch realm.{^n}{^n}You stand before the shrine of Dreeg, the oldest of the three Witch Gods. The Great Guardian sought to know all, to see the truth behind the veil that blinds us all. In arrogance, or perhaps foresight, he cast aside the ancient warnings and the cautionary words of his peers. Dreeg reached into the veil and witnessed the workings of the gods themselves. For his hubris, he was struck blind, but it was then that his eyes had become truly open. Exposed to the wild magic of the eldritch realm, he was forever changed. Cruel spines pierced his flesh, acidic blood dripping from the festering wounds for all eternity. What emerged from beyond the veil bore little resemblance to the man that entered. Dreeg was reborn...a god.{^n}{^n}Dreeg now watches over us all, his peerless gaze pierces through our very souls and sees us for who we really are. To stand before the Great Guardian is an honor without match, to hear His voice is a blessing from the heavens themselves. If you are indeed deserving of his attention, then follow the way of the Three: travel to the broken lands beyond the Arkovian border, where harpies feast on the flesh of the unworthy.

They think us heretics, followers of false gods, and yet none of them can claim to have witnessed the power of their deities. Their...illusions.  Show me the cripples that Menhir has cured; the armies that Oleron has toppled; the beasts that Mogdrogen spared from the hunt. You cannot, because they are not real. But the Witch Gods, born of man, had ascended to raise us from our own ignorance. If you are willing to listen, they may open your eyes as well.{^n}{^n}You now stand before the shrine of Solael, the youngest of the Three. Eldritch fire is at his behest, the very essence of the eldritch realm his to mold and shape as he sees fit. Clothed in black robes that hide his gaunt frame, Solael glides unseen through the shadowy veil to hunt unwitting mortals for their vitality. Many a devout of Solael had been asked to make the ultimate sacrifice, to present themselves before the dark god and offer their life so that Solael may bestow his infinite wisdom upon those that remain.{^n}{^n}You, worthy seeker, do not yet have the attention of the gods, but know that with each step you take you bring yourself closer to the Three. Go now to the frozen lands of the north, where primitive tribes had constructed standing stones ages ago. Armed with the words of Solael and Dreeg, the way shall be opened to you.",

I don't want to diminish the immensity of such a triumph, especially given the small force and limited resources we're working with but I fear it has come at great cost. While our attention was focused on denying the Loghorrean entrance to this world, the Aetherials were certainly not idle.{^n}{^n}Many in Devil's Crossing have paid the ultimate price but such is the way of war and it may sound callous to say but we traded well. Losing only a handful while preventing a monstrosity from escaping the void that could have heralded the end of the world as we know it is a win for humanity.{^n}{^n}What disturbs me though is the loss of Ulgrim to the void. Bourbon apparently does not share my concern and I think he sees it as ill-afforded sentiment on my part. Bourbon sees Ulgrim as merely a man but I am certain there is more to him. I believe he is an ascendant, a man who has become a demi-god.{^n}{^n}Ulgrim expertly plays the part of a jovial and unassuming character but his eyes say much more. He makes off-handed references to historical events with details and a familiarity of someone recalling a personal memory. For all his outward jocularity, there is gravity to him and it is clear he has witnessed much; I suspect more than one could experience in a single lifetime.{^n}{^n}Yet, for all that, and despite his obvious efforts to downplay it, Ulgrim possesses remarkable strength and energy for the middle-aged man he appears to be. He often carries himself in a relaxed, casual manner, moving languidly; but at rare moments, I have seen him react and move with impossible speed.{^n}{^n}I feel that he could do much more than he has, in fighting the enemies of man but I am not sure why he is holding back. Perhaps we will never know now. Maybe Bourbon is right, perhaps Ulgrim is lost to the void. Somehow though, I feel we will see him again and, if we do, it would go a long way toward confirming my suspicions.{^n}{^n}Then again, strange times are these, where a nameless wretch, cut down from the noose, has risen to become possibly the greatest hero of our time.{^n}{^n}If the Taken continues on this path and survives this war, I wonder if perhaps they too are on the path of ascendancy.",

Between Ulgrim and the recent rumors of Mogdrogen, I am concerned that other divinities may also begin involving themselves in worldly affairs; as it is said they did more commonly in ancient times.{^n}{^n}This leads me back to the lingering mystery of Kymon. It is apparent that he and his followers are drawing power from some godlike force, but who or what? I am very doubtful of Kymon's claim that it is Empyrion that guides him, as he initially suggested. The power I sensed in Kymon's emissary to Homestead had a feeling of...malevolence to it.{^n}{^n}Kymon was once a brethren inquisitor, but he went rogue in the years before the Grim Dawn. He is clearly not Aetherial, but I fear he's entered into some manner of dark pact with an unknown power. Certainly if Empyrion, the high-god of legend, returned to Cairn, a power such as that would be felt on a larger scale than merely one raving fanatic leading a group of vagabonds.{^n}{^n}None the less, whatever entity is behind Kymon's Chosen, clearly it does possess significant power and I am troubled, not knowing its identity or motivations.",

And while I initially found the taste nauseating, I've become increasingly fond of its delicate layers and nuances.{^n}{^n}As one of the favored among Scorv's company, I've generally had my pick of the best cuts, so I always enthusiastically go for a butchered portion of leg or upper arm. I ask to leave the bone in, as it really seals in the flavor and keeps the meat juicy after cooking. Nevertheless, my recent experimentations reveal that a shorter cooking time is by far the most satisfying.{^n}{^n}With the addition of some finely chopped black onions and a gentle sprinkling of Wightmire herbs seared alongside the meat, the still bloody cuts make for an exquisite experience that is the envy of everyone in Barrowholm. The critical trick is to sear it on the outside while leaving the inside still dripping with juices.{^n}{^n}Scorv himself said that my inspirations could cure even a ravaging hunger, but I know he just says this to keep up our spirits.

Hunger helped that a bit, I'm sure, but now I feel chills at the thought of a fresh victim. I believe this is what Scorv meant when he said we would become closer to our master.{^n}{^n}The thrill, the energy, the change...I can feel the change. It grows inside of me.

So Frasier had this crazy idea that we should leave and head north. He said there was a nice town just up the road. He should know. He lived up there less than a year ago. He said passage would be difficult but we could make it if we stuck together. He couldn't have been more wrong.{^n}{^n}We weren't one day out of town when things started going poorly. First Beatrix came down with a fever. Her skin went pale and her eyes glazed over. That night, she started lashing out at us, shaking, vomiting and screaming about some creature out in the woods staring back at her. The following day, the same thing happened to Heinrich.{^n}{^n}With both of them sick, we were forced to travel slowly. Frasier and I towed them behind us in a makeshift sled. Too far from Burrwitch to turn back, but Frasier said he knew of an inn that was less than a day's travel ahead, so we continued onward. When we reached the inn it was abandoned and the air hung heavy with the scent of death. But we were desperate and in need of shelter so we stayed there nonetheless.{^n}{^n}That night was when the noises started. Frasier said he didn't hear none of it. But I could make it out loud and clear. It sounded like an animal growling and moving about just outside the inn. As the night wore on, the noises became louder and louder and I began to question my sanity. Frasier insisted that it was nothing but I could swear they were right outside. When dawn came, I didn't want to move but Frasier forced me out of the inn. He said we had to continue or we wouldn't make it to safety. So we began pulling the sled north along the overgrown road.{^n}{^n}As we moved I could hear it following us, its footsteps mirroring our own. Beatrix and Heinrich were getting sicker by the minute and we soon grew tired of hauling the sled. My hands were blistered and my feet bloodied from the rough path. Frasier said we had to leave them, the sled was just too heavy for us to pull, but that didn't sit right with me. We argued back and forth about their fate, each becoming more and more angered as we continued. That was when Frasier grabbed his camp hatchet and threatened to kill them right then and there. He said if I wouldn't let them go, he'd just do it for me. I didn't mean for what happened next, but I was scared and the growling sounds bore down on me like a fire in my mind. I shoved him and he stumbled over a root, falling face first into his hatchet which lodged itself in the right side of his chest. He looked up at me in horror as blood filled his lungs and mouth.{^n}{^n}That's when I saw it, standing behind Frasier at the edge of the woods. A massive hideous figure, like a man with the head of a dead animal. I froze for a moment and then bolted down the road. As I ran I could hear Frasier's gurgling screams begging me not to leave him.{^n}{^n}I can still hear them, all three of them wailing in the darkness like rabbits being eaten by a fox.

Not that you'll hear me complaining about that.{^n}{^n}A fair bit of extra coin has found its way to my pockets as of late, but the folk moving through these parts aren't like the ones we're used to seeing. There's been common folk from further south than Devil's Crossing and groups of men and women moving about with strange new markings on their armor and clothes. We even had a fella a couple a weeks back, claimed he came all the way south from the capital. Said he was a chef looking for work. I didn't have room for him, so I suggested he try in Burrwitch.{^n}{^n}It's not just the people that are strange. There's been an uneasy feeling in the forest as I'm sure you've noticed. I haven't seen nor heard a bird in more than a week. I chalked it up to there being more people around but no more than 3 days ago Critch brought in a fresh kill. It was a big swamp buck, 10-points if I remember correctly. A kill like that usually brings in the vultures but the dressings have been sitting out in the wood festering since and no sight of those hideous things. If it sits out much longer it'll draw out Carraxus for sure. I swear that crusty old bastard has doubled in size and gotten twice as ugly since I last saw him. He's been up around the inn twice in the last year, stealing things. Supposedly he even took a milk cow from Gretchen's stable. I shouldn't like to think what happened to that poor thing. Fire used to scare him off but he seems to have become bolder as he's grown.

The guard barracks was hit first. They were slaughtered, run through like sleeping hens. Their assailants, horrors like nothing man could imagine. I watched them from my shack, stiff as stone, stricken by what I saw. In mere moments, those things had rid the Candle District of its only hope of defense. Then they poured out onto the streets like a putrid green wave of death. The screams of men and the elderly filled my ears and the air became thick with smoke from the green fires that now washed over the district.{^n}{^n}A strange curiosity urged me to watch. I wanted to see more. So I made my way up to the southern wall, moved silently along it and marveled as death swept through the slums below. Men scattered like legions of roaches and were stomped out by the advancing horde. At first, a small group made it to the southern bridge and crossed before it was raised. The rest fled north to the Crown Hill gates only to find them barred and locked. As the horrors closed in behind them, some climbed the walls in desperation, but its slippery stones were hewn to keep the rabble at bay. Most fell to their deaths, crashing down onto the scrambling masses below. Those few who made it to the top met with the blade of the Crown Hill guards who showed no care for the plight of those beneath.{^n}{^n}The slaughter raged on for a time. Now the slums and hovels are silent. They have begun to sweep the city, collecting corpses of the fallen and corrupting those unfortunate souls who survived.{^n}{^n}I rest here now, with no will to continue, no desire to escape. There is no point. The world stands without hope against such foes and so I will spend my final moments in peace.{^n}{^n}-Rennoch The Rat",

Their screams as they woke from sleep to the darkest nightmare still ring in my ears.{^n}{^n}I was crippled with fear. If it weren't for Captain Wilfor's quick action none of us would have survived. My squad and I were fortunate to have been assigned to an overflow area adjacent to the main sleeping quarters, as we were just transferred there the previous day. When the attack started, the captain barged in and began shouting orders at us. Our training took over and we followed, barricading the main door and proceeding outside through the back. What awaited us was unthinkable.{^n}{^n}The world was on fire. A foul stench enveloped the city and a putrid green light burned the sky over the Candle District. At dawn we experienced a series of explosions that shook the foundation of the city like a massive earthquake. The scale of these attacks is unthinkable, the damage indescribable.{^n}{^n}At Wilfor's command, we moved silently about the ruins of the city, from barracks to barracks, in search of other guardsmen. But they all contained the same horrific scene: everyone killed in their sleep, at their posts, just slaughtered.{^n}{^n}I'm beginning to fear that we're all that's left. Wilfor ordered us to protect some civilians while he checks nearby for another group of survivors from the city guard. Just hours ago, we found a dying man who claimed that a stronghold was established near the Candle District by a full contingent of guardsmen.

It seems the quantity of goods entering the city has doubled in the last few months.

Don't know what the fine folk such as yourself need with so many deliveries, but I suppose I'm not paid to ask such questions.{^n}{^n}Had an incident of insubordination recently though when I caught young Orith walking around with a strange crystal, sharp as a blade and green like tarnished copper. I asked him where he'd gotten it, and he was naturally mum about it; but threats to his job got through to him right fast. He said he stole it from one of the Crown Hill deliveries, didn't think nothing of it.

It seems our investment in that vessel was well placed, as you believed it would.{^n}{^n}Our remaining challenge is moving the specimens through the harbor. I have diverted the deliveries to the Blackiron docks, where closer scrutiny of cargo is less probable due to the frequent military shipments, and the overbearing schedule we've imposed upon the dock workers is keeping them too busy to ask questions.{^n}{^n}Despite that, we currently have surprisingly little oversight there. However, Vernath of the Port Authority has proven to be a pleasantly simple target. He is a petty and insecure man, traits that make for easy pickings. Through him, we have ordered the harbormasters to issue weekly reports highlighting unusual activity or unexpected arrivals. This allows us to monitor harbor activity more closely and silence any unfortunate leaks of our plans before we are ready to execute the Glorious Dawn.

  "tagFactionUser9Info": "Headquarters: Ugdenbog {^n}{^n} Not much is known about the mysterious Coven of Ugdenbog. A congregation of witches and warlocks, the coven seeks to shield its persecuted brothers and sisters from a society that does not understand and thus (often rightfully) fears their powers. {^n}{^n} Having successfully evaded the pursuit of the empire's Luminari for decades, the witches created a place of respite deep within the treacherous Ugdenbog, a place not even their determined pursuers dare to tread. This comes with its own dangers however. {^n}{^n} Those who found refuge with the coven must remain ever vigilant as new threats, whether from lost travelers stumbling upon their hideout or from the deadly wildlife of the bog itself, continue to arise. {^n}{^n} Worse still, there are secrets within the bog which even the coven avoids, lest mistakes of the past be repeated and the Luminari rediscover their trail.",
  "tagFactionUser10Info": "Headquarters: Ugdenbog {^n}{^n} Barrowholm, a veritable jewel in the mud, offers a stark contrast to the dangers of the surrounding bog with its nearly immaculate structures and peaceful existence. Its denizens are rightfully protective of their home and offer an unusual mix of caution and warm hospitality to new visitors. {^n}{^n} After all, in a world ravaged by Aetherials and Chthonians, something this perfect must be protected at all costs.",
  "tagFactionUser11Info": "Headquarters: Malmouth {^n}{^n} Once the pride of the east, Malmouth was an industrial marvel in the Erulan empire, with a bustling naval port and a thriving economy. It was also one of the first cities to fall during the events that unfolded on the day of the Grim Dawn. {^n}{^n} Shattered from within by manipulative Aetherials, within mere weeks Malmouth turned from a proud beacon of the empire into a living nightmare for its denizens. But not all citizens of Malmouth perished when the fighting broke out. Some survived...endured...resisted. {^n}{^n} These people now form the backbone of a resistance fighting to take back their city from the scheming invaders; but their resources are running low and human lives are finite when compared to the nigh infinite armies of the Aetherials that have entrenched themselves within Malmouth.",
  "tagFactionUser12Info": " Among the Aetherials that crumbled humanity's empire, in a devastating event now called the Grim Dawn, there were those who reached out beyond the veil first, the ones that would become the heralds of mankind's destruction. {^n}{^n} They were the first to infiltrate the ranks of Erulan, the first to manipulate the unwitting humans to undermine their own cities and governments. This Aetherial Vanguard now spreads its corrupting influence from the ruins that once stood as proud beacons of the fallen empire. {^n}{^n} But all this carnage was merely the beginning of their machinations. At the hands of the Aetherial fleshshapers, vile new creations stir within the depths of Malmouth. Whatever comes next may well mark the end of humanity's resistance.",

From there their leader, a former Luminari inquisitor who now calls himself Father Kymon, has dispatched his fervent followers to gather relics and to wage war against the Chthonic cult.

The whispers from beyond threaten to unravel reality.{^n}{^n}Every night I've spent here, the visions of the other side came more frequently, and with greater clarity. What I first thought were images of darkness turned out to be much more. Within it were the screams of a million souls, crying out to me. Crying out for mercy. As my dreams solidified, I realized that the darkness moved. It writhed like a mass of tentacles endlessly searching for something. The sight of it filled me with terror beyond anything I've ever felt. I awoke gasping for breath and grasping for anything within reach that would remind me that I've left the dream, to the chagrin of my fellow seers sharing the tent.{^n}{^n}Shaken and unable to sleep, I sought the wisdom of the Oracle. To my surprise, or perhaps I should have expected this, my master was already waiting for me inside his tent. Lanterns illuminated him in their flickering light as he sat cross-legged, without his usual regalia, on a rug with tea set out for us. As he stared ahead with his blank eyes, he gave me a tight-lipped smile and motioned for me to sit.{^n}{^n}Before I could utter a word, he said: Yugol. I was taken aback and blinked. The Oracle continued by describing exactly what I had seen in my dreams, as if he had been there to share them with me. The Insatiable Night, he called it, the eternal darkness that exists in the beyond. It is primordial, unfathomable to the human mind. We see it as a mass of writhing tentacles, but what it truly is cannot be described in words. Yugol exists to consume everything, its endless pursuit halted only by the light of the celestial stars.{^n}{^n}I was told that it is a gift and a burden to bear witness to the makings of reality. What I had seen cannot be unseen. When I started visibly shaking, the Oracle placed his palm upon my forehead and for a moment I could swear his eye tattoos were staring at me. Yet I found myself instantly calmed.{^n}{^n}When I asked what he had done, he would not say, but he offered to teach me a technique to calm myself and banish the darkness from my nightmares. It is a lucid method by which I would conjure my own stars into the dream, brighter than the desert sun.{^n}{^n}I thanked him for his wisdom and promised to return the next eve for my lesson. As I stood to leave, I glanced in his direction. He was staring ahead, as before, a somber expression on his face. His tea remained untouched. I said no more and closed the tent flap behind me.{^n}{^n}It would seem my visions have disturbed the Oracle as well, but I trust that his judgment and foresight will carry us through whatever darkness looms on the horizon.

Together we have focused our efforts on ancient lore that speaks of a magnificent city of gold, hidden deep in the burning desert; a city whose people and culture vanished generations ago. By following the works of Rion the Scholar, sparse regional folklore and a number of cryptic religious texts, we were able to piece together a potential location for the lost city.{^n}{^n}From Rion's writings, we know that the main port of entry to the Korvan civilization was a place called the Cairan Docks, a massive coastal city positioned in a protective bay just inland of a large river delta. However, recovered Korvan folklore claims that the waters of this river delta and the protective bay where Cairan was situated turned to flame and were burned away during the supposed cataclysmic event that ended the civilization. After speaking with a number of shipping merchants and retired sailors we have pinpointed a location that fits this description. A strip of land where the desert meets the sea, just north of Cape Erine. The terrain and weather here are apparently so treacherous that few have ventured far from the coast.{^n}{^n}It should not go unmentioned that funding for our expedition was provided by a number of wealthy individuals from both Erulan and Malmouth. It does concern me that their interests in the lost city may not align with ours. And they have sent a retinue of individuals to monitor our progress and look after their investment. I am concerned that they may attempt to interfere if things don't seem to be going their way. Roderick assures me that, whatever their intentions, we will not allow them to waylay us from our goal.

I have lost track of time as I watch the ship's crew go about their routine day in and day out. I feel more than a bit useless but the captain has explained, a number of times, that our involvement will only make his crew less efficient. So I sit, read, watch the clouds pass overhead and review my notes over and over again.{^n}{^n}That all changed this morning shortly after dawn when I was violently awoken by the sound of cannon fire. The shattering boom gave me such a start that I fell out of my hammock. When I rushed above deck the scene was somewhere between utter chaos and military precision. Before I could determine what was happening the captain ordered Roderick and I below deck.{^n}{^n}Later when the fracas had subsided, I had a chance to speak with him. Evidently, the dawn watchman spotted another ship with no colors flying; a sure sign of piracy, the Captain said. Instead of risking an attack he decided to go on the offensive and begin firing as soon as the ship was in range. Whatever he did, it worked and the other ship fled. However, it appears this is a common tactic among pirates of the region. They follow ships and attempt an attack at night when the crew is less alert.

For it is the blood of his love that gives liquid life to the valley of the Eldritch Sun.{^n}{^n}Before the walls of the temple gleamed in the light of Rahn, before the first of the Korvan people arrived to build the foundations of their faith, there was only Horran.{^n}{^n}Scorned and persecuted by his people for the depth of his faith in the god of gods, Horran fled to the burning desert to seek a life of devotion in solitude. For a time, the desert provided for him as it had not provided for any creature before him. There, Horran lived happily and spent his waking hours meditating upon his faith.{^n}{^n}In time, as do all virile creatures, Horran grew lonely. And so he prayed to our eldritch patron, pledging all he possessed for the pleasures of companionship. As the glow of Ateph graced the burning sands, he fell ill and, though a cool night drew upon him, the heat of the day still burned in his skin. His god bade him sleep and as he slept a feverish vision overtook him.{^n}{^n}At daybreak, Horran awakened from his dream and set upon his quest. With his sole possession, Aineth, the goat which had given the best of its years to run thick with milk for him and whose offspring he had gorged himself upon, he marched deeper into the desert. The burning light of Rahn weighed heavily on him that morning and for seven days hence he marched without food or rest. On the fifth day Aineth, like many creatures before it, succumbed to the heat and could go no further. With waning strength, Horran carried the beast and cared for it until his body would serve him no more.{^n}{^n}There, at the end of his journey, Horran collapsed and prayed to the Eldritch Sun for mercy. His god commanded he lay dead Aineth, to slit the beast's neck and drain its blood upon the sands, and Horran did as his master asked. As the crimson waters of Aineth's life ran out upon the sand, it hissed and burned in the midday sun. From the pool of burning life there arose a woman. Eyahna she was called and she poured upon Horran the love for which he had so yearned.{^n}{^n}Together Eyahna and Horran knew only ecstasy and for a time they were happy. But their love bore no fruit and so they once again prayed to their god to sate their desires. Thusly Yahlia was born. A child of such immense beauty that Rahn and Ateph both became jealous of how the light of the sun and of the moon danced and sparkled in her eyes. Eyahna and Horran were happy once more.{^n}{^n}But there was a gift that was given and a price that was yet to be paid and so the desert turned against them. Struggle and strife beset Eyahna and Horran. Food aged and rotted at their touch. Water turned to sand as they drank and young Yahlia fell ill of hunger.{^n}{^n}With nowhere to turn, Horran begged his god for mercy and the Eldritch Sun answered. But to save the life of Yahlia there was a price that needed to be paid. Horran once again did as his master bade him and gathered up the blade which had slain Aineth. Then, as he stood there hovering over the bed of Eyahna, the jagged and terrible blade raised high above him, Horran's faith faltered. He could not take the life of his love, not even to save Yahlia. Horran turned the blade upon himself and drew its claw-like edge across his throat, but it made no mark. Then, Eyahna called out and clutched desperately at her neck, the red life seeping out between her fingers. Horran ran to her side but it was too late. The warm blood flowed from her body and pooled in the sand beneath his feet. From the pool of Eyahna's life there burst a ceaseless spring of cleansing water.{^n}{^n}The Eldritch Sun had once again answered his prayers, but Horran's life was not his own to take. Horran bathed Yahlia in the water of the spring and she was healed. But the lovely child would never forgive him for the death of her mother. As the cost for his greed, Horran was cursed with ceaseless life such that he might remember the death of his beloved Eyahna for all eternity and so that one day he might hold Yahlia in his arms as she too drew her final breath.{^n}{^n}Such is the price of godhood.",

They also seem like a terribly conflicted lot, all pledging themselves to different deities, none of whom seem to get along very well.{^n}{^n}They've somehow roped my brothers into joining their little cult, though I suspect those two aren't buying into the mumbo jumbo the witches are peddling. More likely they think we'll turn a healthy profit by going along with the whole deal. If that's the case, Aaral and Anderan are doing an awfully good job hiding it. They're joining in with daily rituals, kowtowing to their new god. It's an odd sight, those two fools pretending they care for anything other than making themselves rich. I wonder how long it will be until they try to get me to join in with them. I haven't had an opportunity to speak with them about it, but deceiving a group of fanatics like this could be dangerous business.{^n}{^n}For the time being, the witches have kept us well supplied and there seems to be no shortage of grave robbing they want us to do. I don't exactly know what they're looking for but they don't seem to have any interest in the usual trinkets. They were rather displeased with our first haul, saying it was all useless junk. We just grabbed what usually sells well, jewelry, anything that looks expensive, but they said to focus our efforts on items that seem to have greater importance, auras, whatever that means.{^n}{^n}On top of all else, things are heating up in camp. The witches seem to be preparing for something, arguing amongst themselves, making plans in secret. There's a lot of strange people coming and going and some rather concerning rumors about goings-on to the north in the ruins of Korvan City. We don't have any plans to head out there though, at least I hope not.{^n}{^n}This morning it's off to the Cairan Docks for a second run. There's a network of tombs and temples beneath the ruins that the witches seem particularly interested in. We've been down there before and most of those places seemed like they were picked over years ago. But maybe the stuff with...auras is still down there. In any case, I'll have my hands full keeping Aaral and Anderan out of trouble, as usual.",

In my travels I have been to the farthest reaches of the world, seen and experienced much, sadly most sights did not live up to their own tales. This place, however, is a marvel that exceeds even the grandest of stories. Transcribing its beauty and grandeur may prove challenging even for me.{^n}{^n}I arrived via ship at the Cairan Docks late last night. My charter, a merchant vessel called Spire, packed to the gunwale with fine goods from distant shores; its captain, a stalwart and grizzled sailor whose dedication and leadership shone through in the motivation of his crew. Like a finely tuned machine they deftly navigated the dangerous waters west of the Korvan River delta.{^n}{^n}We first spotted the grand port while still at sea, miles before entering the river where it is located. The Cairan beacon shone brightly over the horizon. I do not know what magic powers that ubiquitous signal but its intense light draws vessels from the seas like moths to a flame. As we sailed upriver, the port began to reveal itself to us like an eager maiden. Countless warm yellow lights gently illuminated polished sandstone structures, some more than five stories tall. Beautifully crafted statues and fountains proudly stood watch over the gardens and public spaces that flowed through the grand bazaar.{^n}{^n}The port itself was ablaze with activity. Containers hoisted to and from ships, dock workers and merchants closing deals and crews taking leave in bars and fine brothels. Mere moments after I set foot on solid ground, for the first time in weeks, I was greeted by my local contact. A beautiful woman of middling age with an effortless and enticing gait further enhanced by the lovely gold embroidered gown that hung over her figure like a graceful waterfall. She guided me away from the pier to the heart of the port city, and my lodging for the night; which I politely offered to share with her, an advance she graciously denied. Not even this could dampen my mood however and, albeit alone, I had the greatest night of sleep in my life. The bazaar gently rocked me to sleep with the melodic hum of its ceaseless activity.{^n}{^n}This morning, my path takes me north to the capital, Korvan City. I shall join a small caravan that travels there daily along the immaculate stone roads leading to the heart of the city from the four cardinal directions. I can see the path now, as I sit and wait in the lovely garden bower just outside my lodging. Its stonework shines in the gentle morning sun. Immaculate golden leafed braziers mark its boundaries as far as the eye can see.{^n}{^n}If the next leg of my journey rivals the first, it shall truly be the experience of a lifetime.",

During our first week at sea, a freak storm flooded the hold and ruined a fair portion of our better provisions. The steward's been forced to dole out smaller portions than I'm sure he'd like; there were more than a few threats to his life come mealtimes.{^n}{^n}To add to the lean conditions, a particularly bold band of native pirates attempted to board the ship from a small canoe as we passed near the Tarken Islands. I didn't know what they were thinking at the time as they had little chance of sacking the ship. Not a one of them was fully dressed and only two of the five were armed, if you can call it that. They carried no more than roughly fashioned spears. Little did we know they were so lethal. The crew's response was expectedly concise and the attempted raid was stopped almost before it started. However, two of the crew, Barken the deck hand, and Rennet our new swabbie, sustained minor injuries from the incident. Both took ill and died no more than a day later. It turned out those half naked bastards were planning to poison us all in our sleep. They got what they deserved, hogtied and keel hauled. Some of the crew suggested less savory ends but it's important not to allow the rabble to run rampant in such situations. As it is, I allowed them to keep the hands. It's a foul practice, if you ask me, but they do fetch a fine coin if you can source the right buyer. I'm sure the old boatswain Yarik will have no trouble finding someone to sell them to here.{^n}{^n}This is to be the first of three nights at port as the ship's cargo is sold and her hold replenished. I've given the crew their leave which I am sure they will take at local taverns and homes of ill repute. As is well deserved no doubt. I shall tend to the ship's business and attempt to source cargo for our return journey.{^n}{^n}The Cairan port is truly a sight to behold. Many times larger than any this captain has seen in his many years at sea. Hundreds of ships make landfall and just as many, with bellies full of cargo, wait at the mouth of the river. The docks churn like a well-oiled machine and the pristine city beyond glistens in the moonlight as if bathing in its rays. Yet, in my short time ashore I have seen the all but hidden evidence of the dark underbelly that bolsters any successful port. Back alley dealings, wealthy merchants treading on the less fortunate, a ship whose hold is overflowing with bound and chained folk, stolen from a far-off land. I am certain our return journey will be a profitable one, though I hope to haul a less unsavory cargo.",

Silently we snuck past the night guard, through gardens, over walls, out of sight, down to the docks where I paused for a moment in amazement. They were ablaze with activity, I couldn't believe my eyes. While the rest of the city slept, the docks positively hummed with activity. I'd never seen them at night.{^n}{^n}Anhad grasped my hand and snapped me out of my stupor. He led me down a secret path running next to the docks out past the last ship. From there we could see the bay stretching out before us. Its rippled surface sparkled in the light of Ateph. It was more beautiful than I could have imagined. We could see ships entering the bay, their sails like pale specters against the jewel-filled night sky. It was Anhad's plan all along for us to go swimming. Swimming, of all things. Father would lose his mind. He's forbidden me to swim, he says it's inappropriate for a young woman.{^n}{^n}Anhad has promised to teach me but tonight he guided me down to the shore so I could wade in up to my waist. The water was like a warm bath and Nirdu fish nibbled at my toes as I walked. Anhad swam out past the pier, so far I could barely make him out against the glimmering water. I've heard there are massive fish that linger out there, waiting for a ship to drop scraps or for someone to fall overboard, but now I think those are mere tales people tell children to keep them from swimming.{^n}{^n}Why would they want to keep anyone from doing this, it's incredible.

Our time is spent cautiously picking our way through arid canyons and barren valleys with no sign of civilization. We are forced to travel huddled together with armed guards at our flanks, a cumbersome but necessary measure. One of our porters was mauled by an unknown predator while relieving himself. We must be incredibly cautious to prevent further attacks.{^n}{^n}I am no expert in the study of animals but I have witnessed many here that defy my understanding of the natural world. Massive reptiles skulking in the dunes. Flying predators with wingspans as large as a ship. Beetle-like insects the size of a man. This is a place of deep primordial energy, I feel certain we are on the right path.{^n}{^n}Day - 31{^n}Today we have reached the first true evidence of civilization. The lotus symbolism and crumbled remains of guardian statues that I've previously only seen depicted in texts made it abundantly clear that these were indeed the remnants of the Korvan people. Around midday, we walked clear of the insipid and deathly dry desert and there laid out before us were the sprawling ruins of a once glorious city. Beyond the sand covered husks of buildings, I could make out the remnants of a massive port and the bones of ancient ships now resting on the dry salt bed. There was no doubt about it. These were the Cairan Docks, the port that connected Korvan City to the luxurious trade routes that brought power and riches untold to these shores. Beyond it the now barren bay that served as its connection to the outside world. Our efforts are paying off, we are now on the path once trod by the Eldritch Sun himself.{^n}{^n}Day - 32{^n}We've uncovered an ancient bathhouse and temple complex at the center of the port city. Our accompaniment insisted on exploring the ruins and carefully cataloguing every grain of sand that appeared unique to them.

I realize that it is not our place as mortals to judge the behavior of the gods, for their whims are beyond our limitations to understand, but this course of events warrants apprehension.{^n}{^n}Since his return, the divine has not been himself. He has ever been on the bottle that our temple's stock cannot replenish quickly enough. I've been forced to instruct our aspirants to seize incoming shipments of wine before they can be claimed by local merchants. But even that is not enough to sate his bloated appetite.{^n}{^n}A Cairan caravan was rerouted to the temple on a daily basis, bringing in fresh courtesans for the pleasures of our patron. I've received numerous complaints from the merchant guild regarding the seizure of shipments and their caravan, but these voices were quickly silenced when I invoked Ulzuin's name in their presence.{^n}{^n}I imagine none of this sounds alarming on its own, however more recently the divine has taken an unusual interest in a particular maiden of the temple. She is a young and ambitious priestess and I admit the mighty Ulzuin has good taste. Her brilliant emerald eyes shine underneath that raven black hair and her face glows with lustful desire. At first, I wrote it off as another of the divine's conquests, but he has begun to shun others in her favor. At times, our own attendants are denied access to Ulzuin's chambers so that she may tend to his wounds and wishes personally.{^n}{^n}I braved the celestial's wrath and suggested that it may be dangerous for a god to allow a single mortal to grow so close to him when so many are in need of his guidance and protection. Even in his weakened state, Ulzuin hurled a stone brazier in my direction with ease, damaging the mosaic upon the wall and turning the brazier into mere rubble. I dare not show my face to him again until his anger has subsided.{^n}{^n}It is clear to me now that this young priestess has consumed the divine's attention, like a spider ensnaring a victim in its web. If we cannot speak sense to Ulzuin, then we must keep eye upon her, learn of her methods and motives. It is possible that she merely desires to taste the pleasures of divine flesh, but I've never seen our mighty lord so enthralled by a mortal.{^n}{^n}I call upon all my brethren to take heed of this warning and join me in my endeavor without drawing the ire of our patron. But if Ulzuin cannot protect himself from these mortal pursuits, then we will need to take the necessary measures, for the good of the Korvan people, of course.",

  "tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_TombsNoteA02Text": "Rhenet was not always a rat and did not always preside over the vermin and lowly creatures of the Korvan Basin. He was once a powerful and proud man, a merchant whose wealth rivaled any who bask in the light of Rahn.{^n}{^n}But he was not born into the life of wealth and power. No, he was born a diseased and lowly vagrant to a widowed mother with nothing more to give him than her faith in the Eldritch Sun. And so, unable to care for her sickly child, she prayed to her god and pledged her own life so that Rhenet would be spared the plight that was his birthright. The desperate mother's prayers were answered and miraculously the infant grew to become a healthy child.{^n}{^n}As a young man Rhenet was conscripted to the service of a trade ship where it is said that even the cruel sea showed him favor. He grew strong and clever in his service and his skill as a sailor brought him much renown. He worked furiously to honor the life he was given and through his drive and dedication became the captain of the ship to which he served.{^n}{^n}His success at sea was so great that he would one day return to the Cairan Docks and from there command an armada of ships that sailed in his name. It was from this position of power that he built his grand wealth and from which he began to forget his humble origins. The success of his life so tainted his ego that Rhenet began to believe he was destined for greatness, that a life such as his could not be a coincidence. He sought greater power and forgot the gift which was given.{^n}{^n}Those who served or were loyal to Rhenet showered him with their adoration and his pride grew with his wealth. The shade of his origins was all but forgotten as Rhenet proclaimed himself the master of the seas and commissioned the first of many temples to be constructed in his honor. Quickly, sailors and seafarers began paying tribute, leaving riches and treasures at these sites of worship. It was said that the favor of Rhenet bestowed good fortune upon those who took to the sea. Some even perceived him as a god of the waters, an ascendant whose legend spread beyond even the Korvan waters.{^n}{^n}But the grand hubris of Rhenet drew the ire of his benefactor. And so, the Eldritch Sun left his throne, disguising himself as an elderly vagrant so he could walk amongst the people of the Korvan Basin. There he heard the adulation for Rhenet, listened as the people spoke of the man as if he stood among Korvaak's Chosen, those few mortals whose service and dedication to the Eldritch Sun had earned them a place aside his throne. This rightly enraged the divine and in his disguised form he sought court with the self-appointed god of the seas.{^n}{^n}In a grand temple built in his name, Rhenet met with the old man. He laughed at the sight of the sickly and broken creature before him.  \"What have you to give the master of the seas, you poor old fool?\" asked Rhenet.{^n}{^n}\"I have come to remind you of the life you should have lived,\" the man said meekly.  \"I am you as you should have been, were it not for the kindness of the Eldritch Sun.\"{^n}{^n}Rhenet laughed once again \"You have come here to threaten me? Who are you to speak for the gods? How dare you?\"{^n}{^n}And with that the old man's voice boomed, shaking the earth beneath their feet. His form twisted and grew as he spoke and a blistering heat washed over Rhenet, burning away his clothes, peeling and bubbling his flesh. \"I do not come to threaten, I have come to collect upon the gift which was given.\"{^n}{^n}The searing heat cleansed Rhenet of his pride and he cowered before the towering figure. \"Forgive me,\" begged Rhenet, \"I did not know.\"{^n}{^n}\"What have you to give me you poor little creature,\" the figure boomed.{^n}{^n}\"I give my life,\" cried Rhenet.{^n}{^n}\"Indeed. But death is too small a price. No, you shall serve me as the lowliest of creatures you have always been. You will hold court over those who saw you as a god.\"{^n}{^n}With those final words, Rhenet's body collapsed upon itself, twisting, tearing and grinding until finally he appeared as a massive diseased rat. His temples were brought to ruin in an instant, and from the rubble emerged a swarm of rats. All of those who had followed the master of the sea, all who had pledged their loyalty to him or begged for his favor were cursed to live out their days as vile vermin in the service of the Rat God.{^n}{^n}Take heed of the story of Rhenet, for all things that we cherish in life are gifts of the Eldritch Sun.",

However, these are the types of emotions which spur wavering faith and thoughts of dissent. There are even some who speak openly against the temple. Though they are few in number, I am concerned that recent events may embolden them. They have the potential to become the rotting core at the center of a larger movement.{^n}{^n}In the meantime, I have pleaded to the elders for guidance, for words of calm that I might share with the patrons of the temple.

It is a wild place where towering basalt formations jut from the ground like the bones of an ancient beast. I don't know what happened here but it appears as if the earth turned itself inside out, spewing its jagged entrails across the valley floor. The land rests now but signs of ancient turmoil abound.{^n}{^n}I must say I am pleasantly surprised to find that Amal's map has been accurate. When he bought the old rag from a wandering junk peddler and then tried to convince me to join his little treasure hunt I was skeptical to say the least. After all, what kind of traveling trash merchant carries a genuine treasure map, for a few measly iron bits no less. Even if the map was real, I thought, what business do Amal and I have trekking through a burning desert to raid some poor soul's long-forgotten grave. But he's really come through this time; the map is in fact real and, remarkably, Amal has led us this far without incident. According to the map, it won't be more than a half day's journey to the place they once called the Valley of the Chosen, or so Amal says. I'm relying entirely on him as I cannot read the supposed ancient language the map is written in. How he can is beyond me.{^n}{^n}There are signs of a once mighty civilization everywhere. I've seen buildings, statues, tombs and temples. Some stand as if they were erected yesterday but most have fallen prey to the ravages that tore through this land long ago. If I didn't know better, I'd say the earth itself had reared up to lay waste to the structures built here, intentionally razing some and leaving others untouched. It is an unnerving thought, no doubt.{^n}{^n}I do not know what happened to this place, or to the people that must have inhabited it, or why no one has returned to reclaim it. Amal tells me stories of cataclysmic events, the roiling hot blood of the earth pouring over the land, unnatural beasts risen to exact the vengeful punishment of a scorned god. I honestly don't know if he's making it up to scare me or if he genuinely believes that's what happened here.{^n}{^n}In the end, all that matters is that everyone left in a hurry and they left a whole lot of valuables behind.

Just over the crest, as far as the eye could see, the harsh volcanic landscape was dotted with tomb entrances and monuments whose golden inlays sparkled in the bright moonlight; all of which were centered along a main corridor of grand burial crypts.{^n}{^n}It was an equally exhilarating and daunting sight as I was not looking forward to traversing volcanic rock and leaping over molten rivers. And I have to say there's been some strange goings-on as we draw nearer to our goal. This morning I could swear that the earth itself shook me awake and in the last fitful moments of sleep I dreamt of being consumed by fire, sinking deeper and deeper into an endless ocean of flame. As I jerked back to the realm of the waking I saw Amal sleeping like a freshly suckled pig, clutching his empty rum cask like the teat of a generous mother. It must have been in my head, perhaps an anxious dream brought on by the anticipation of the final leg of our journey and the riches that might be buried in the valley ahead.{^n}{^n}But later, as we broke camp, I noticed something very peculiar. We arrived last night well after sunset and I would have bet my life we made our camp at the foot of a massive statue. This morning, it was missing. I was dumbstruck. Not only was it gone but there were gargantuan footprints leading away from it like those of a man wearing heavy boots, only many times larger. They were deep and the stride was long as if the statue had just walked off in the night or some massive man had slung it over his shoulder and made off with it.{^n}{^n}When I told Amal he seemed surprised at first, but then brushed it off. He insisted there was no statue, that the full moon played a cruel trick on me. I think he saw it too, I'm certain of it, but he's so focused on finding treasure that he won't admit to any distractions.{^n}{^n}If that weren't enough, as we made our way down into the valley I could swear I saw an entire caravan of men and women dressed in long gray robes and heavy armor off in the distance. They were traveling northward along the ridgeline next to the tombs, chanting as they went. By the time I got Amal to stop gaping at the gold inlay on the temple door we were going to pry open, he missed seeing them entirely. I feel as though I'm losing my mind but I'm quite positive we are not alone here.{^n}{^n}I don't suppose it matters much at this point. We've reached our goal, the tomb marked on Amal's map is right beneath our feet. This one, among so many, supposedly holds grand riches. Perhaps once we're inside, I can breathe easy away from all the weirdness happening out here; if we can figure out how to get the damned thing open.",

Groaning and rumbling, the bedrock beneath the temple cried out like a waking beast.{^n}{^n}I panicked and began to run but every step seemed to aggravate the beast further. I made it less than 20 feet before the shaking brought me to my knees. I continued to crawl, scraping my arms against the jagged stone floor, with no concept of where I was going, no plan of escape.{^n}{^n}With a bone-shattering crack, the floor of the temple opened like a gaping maw, revealing the white hot river of flame below. I could not have imagined the depth of terror that consumed me in that moment as Amal's desperate screams echoed through the passage behind me. I somehow summoned the courage to move and dragged myself away from the searing heat. For a time, I cowered there as the tomb shook around me. Its groans and cracks resembled an oppressive voice that called out to me, that called out to all living things from the depths of the fiery river that flowed around me.{^n}{^n}Then, as the shaking subsided, there was calm. I could still hear other cracks and booms in far off places, but the temple I lay in was still.{^n}{^n}Now there is nothing, nothing but the sizzle and drone of the molten earth that now defines the island of solid rock that will be my final resting place.

I kept asking what the others were muttering about, but they would laugh, saying that I was merely hearing things. As our days of digging and opening tombs continued, I became convinced that they were conspiring to slit my throat. I refused to sleep. I grew weary and delusional. The whispers kept gnawing at my mind.{^n}{^n}Yesterday, as we made our way into the latest tomb, the voices took their toll. We had found a small opening on the surface through which we were able to descend via rope. As soon as my feet touched the dusty tiles, however, I was but a passenger in my own body; trapped behind my own eyes. As my companions moved into the inky depths, my hands reached for the rope and soaked it with lamp oil. I screamed to warn the others, but I had no voice. I stared in horror as our only means of escape vanished in a brief blaze.{^n}{^n}Deeper inside, I found Harnen overlooking a golden railing near a waterfall. My hands came up into my vision as if to push him. I tried to fight my arms down, I commanded my mouth to make any noise, but nothing came of it. I was powerless and could only watch as his hands shot out in desperation, grasping for anything within reach...the railing, the wall...me. His eyes met mine with the final fearful question: why? Then he was gone, tumbled over the railing and out of sight into the ravine.{^n}{^n}Belik was not far from my grisly deed. I found him admiring the intricate work of gold-encrusted statue. The figure was frightening, with too many arms gripping a razor-sharp halberd as if at the ready to defend the tomb. There was an eerie quality of unlife about it that made my blood run cold.{^n}{^n}In a flash, my hands were wrapped around Belik's arms and I lifted him with inhuman strength way up into the air before forcing his back onto the statue's weapon. I released him and watched as he slowly slid down the length of the halberd, his blood pouring down along the shaft and pooling at the foot of the statue.{^n}{^n}It was at that moment when my last friend was dead that whatever spell had enthralled me had ended. Freed from my mental prison, I screamed and wailed and pounded on the cold stones like a distraught child. For a brief moment, I could swear I saw a withered face clad in golden armor staring back at me, but then it was gone. I can't say when or how, but I pulled Belik down off the statue. Nor do I know how long I laid there holding my dead friend. My mind was broken.{^n}{^n}There was no hope of escape, I saw to that. By my own hand, I became trapped down here to waste away and rot to bone with my fallen companions. I needed to write this. If not for myself, then for my friends. I can only pray their spirits know in their hearts that it was not me, and they will greet me with forgiveness when I see them beyond the veil.{^n}{^n}Gods preserve me, my hands were not my own.",

The natural predators are emboldened, attacking single travelers and sometimes the caravans themselves in broad daylight. In all my time managing the Caravan, I have seen nothing like it. They appear crazed as if driven mad by something. In addition, there have been numerous sightings of previously unknown and peculiar beasts, seen traveling in packs, stalking caravans through the deepest desert. One of my most trusted drivers even reported a gryphon matriarch down on the valley floor. What could possibly drive those behemoths down from their lofty perches?{^n}{^n}Whatever it is, we need to secure the caravans or risk shipments stopping all together.

When I missed a shipment of Vaurine Wine last week, for the second month in a row, I personally made the trip to Cairan to inquire with my importer. After a fair bit of coercion and no small amount of coin, he told me that a temple attendant signed the cargo manifest and then made off with my wine. I then spoke with a number of other local sellers and it seems they too have been missing product they've been expecting through the Cairan caravan. I do not mean to imply that they are appropriating the goods, certainly not. They are in fact not only paying for our wares but also bribing importers to keep quiet about their little dealings. A fine waste of our tax money, no doubt.{^n}{^n}I mean to take this up with the merchant guild as soon as possible and I implore you to do the same.

  "tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_KorvanCityNoteA03Text": "I arrived today at the heart of Korvan City after a grueling three days of travel, a journey which began on a high note as we traversed the lush oasis just beyond the walls of the Cairan Docks. The Korvan capital is something else entirely. Lush stands of palms grace the shores of flowing streams fed by subterranean springs, which bubble up from the depths with an irrepressible ferocity. In the midst of a stark desert it is truly a sight to behold.{^n}{^n}I've been told that this one source provides the cleanest of waters to the region. Apparently an entire class of water merchants exists, with the sole duty of collecting the life-giving nectar from there and distributing it throughout the land.{^n}{^n}This is also where I had my first exposure to the curious and deep-rooted faith of the region. My traveling companions, the daily caravan from Cairan Docks to Korvan City, insisted that we stop at a temple, known as the Sanctuary of Horran, positioned in the heart of the oasis. It was apparently crucial that they stop while the burning sun was at its highest point, the prescribed hour to observe a daily ritual in which they give thanks to their god for his mercy and pittance.{^n}{^n}I can understand why a culture surrounded by such harsh and unforgiving lands would be grateful for whatever it is that has graced them to create such a stunning civilization. However, I quickly learned to be wary of these rituals as the prescribed hour for worship is not one but several a day. I know now why the journey to Korvan City takes three days.{^n}{^n}On the second day of our journey we passed through a smaller city on the outskirts of Korvan. This was truly an unusual locale. It appeared to be more temple than practical residence. I surmise it is a center for religious practice, perhaps where the local faith's most devout followers can go about their various rituals unhindered by the bustle of Korvan proper. Just beyond the temple city lies a vast network of tombs. I was told, by one of the caravan's drivers, that previous Korvan leaders and powerful devotees of the Korvan faith are buried there along with countless precious relics. Apparently the valley was chosen as a burial site because the roiling hot blood of their god flows close to the surface there. I suspect there is an ancient magma flow passing beneath the valley, perhaps the remnants of a long dormant volcano.{^n}{^n}These revelations are quite curious and worthy of further investigation. I shall hope to learn a great deal more about this faith, its practices and practitioners during my time in Korvan City.",

  "tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_KorvanCityNoteA04Text": "Today was my first full day in Korvan City and I must say I am as awestruck by its majesty as I was when I first landed at the Cairan Docks. The focal point of the city is a grand temple dedicated to the Eldritch Sun, Korvaak, a deity I am unfamiliar with but one that dominates local theology. The temple's majesty is indescribable. It seems to dwarf everything in sight, even nearby mountains. And it radiates with such an energy that its heat can be felt even in the midday sun. Even I, a skeptic, find myself in sheer admiration. I've been told that the heat of the temple had dwindled for some years but has recently rekindled, a cause for celebration and ritual. I suspect it is built on a geological feature, perhaps a volcano or hot spring of some sort. I should very much wish to gain access to the inside. Though, as I discovered by visiting several smaller temples around the city, this is unlikely to happen. The main temple holds particular importance and entry is strictly prohibited to outsiders.{^n}{^n}Though it appears to be the focal point of the local faith, Korvaak is by no means the only entity worshipped by the Korvan people. There also appear to be lesser gods whom the people call ascendants. What that means exactly, I am not clear on and nobody had a straight answer for me either. The stories regarding these individuals vary, and not all of them seem to be holy men or even devout practitioners.  By my observation, they may well be wealthy individuals that have bought their way to deification and the social reverence that comes with. Nonetheless, minor temples were constructed in their honor and they are all worshipped in their own right and for various means, sometimes even before death.{^n}{^n}I should very much like to know what qualifies a person for a place of such honor and so tomorrow I will be visiting several temples positioned around the main Temple of the Eldritch Sun. If birthright will not grant me access, then perhaps the grease of a few coins will.",

  "tagGDX2LoreObj_AreaG_KorvanCityNoteA05Text": "Following today's investigation of the tombs and temples of Korvan City, I must say I am more confused and, frankly, enthralled by the Korvan faith than I could have possibly imagined.{^n}{^n}Today I had the privilege to bear witness to a ceremony at the Temple of Rahn, where the ascendant himself was present to perform the honorable rite. It is my understanding that Rahn holds domain over the sun itself and it is by his blessing that the sun rises each day to warm the earth and give life to the harvest. The ceremony itself was brief and involved the slaughter of five goats upon the golden altar, their blood spilled into the carving in the form of a many-pronged sun.{^n}{^n}Rahn was a splendor to behold, his skin as golden as the suit of armor he wore. The armor glowed with burning energy and yet, as some of the acolytes in the temple described to me from their blessed opportunities to lay their hands upon it, is cool to the touch. With the way he presents himself it is easy to see why his followers believe this man to be a deity. The acolytes tell me that this is actually the 12th incarnation of Rahn. His father was the 11th and so on down the patriarchal chain of his family. Each of them had allegedly lived for centuries, and each had willingly given his life in the service of the Eldritch Sun. I was astonished to discover that the deification of this figure was his birthright. It does however lend credence to my suspicions regarding the true nature of these Korvan gods.{^n}{^n}The acolytes of this temple were more than eager to share Rahn's history with me. I swear if I let them, they'd talk all day of his countless accomplishments and divine intervention. But what did catch my attention was the presumed rivalry between Rahn and another deity they call Ateph, the lord of the moon. As this rivalry heated up, Ateph, I've learned, had slighted the Eldritch Sun and was thus banished from setting foot in Korvan City or to ever again feel the warmth of day upon his flesh.{^n}{^n}But the divine Korvaak was not without mercy. Once every 30 cycles of the sun, the disgraced Ateph was to make pilgrimage to Korvan City and make an offering upon the grand temple steps. This is an extraordinary and incredibly creative explanation for the cycling of day and night and the wax and wane of the moon.{^n}{^n}If this strange practice of ascension weren't enough, the people of the Korvan valley also appear to deify native animals and sometimes odd combinations of people and animals. The Korvan gryphon is a particularly common target of this practice. The creatures apparently live in rigid hierarchical packs which elevate a singular, usually male, individual to an alpha known by the Korvan people as a Sovereign. These gryphon Sovereigns are then worshiped by locals as minor deities.{^n}{^n}The intricacies of the Korvan faith are remarkable but it must not go unmentioned that they all lead back to Korvaak in one fashion or another. I shall focus future investigations on this penultimate deity.",

I have been so enveloped by my work that I've lost track of the rising and setting of the sun, Rahn would be so disappointed in me.{^n}{^n}I find it difficult to pull my attention away. I've hired a young man to bring me meals three times a day and I must admit they are piling up outside the door to my chambers. My time is spent poring over mountains of texts and tomes, rites and ceremonies in an attempt to better understand the origins of this Korvaak.{^n}{^n}What I have learned thus far is truly fascinating. As far back as I can go, there seems to be no inconsistency to his presence or domain, no evolution of his worship. It is as if the core of the Korvan religion had somehow remained pure since its inception, quite unusual. It is that or its founders had put a great deal of effort into obscuring its true origins. The texts I've perused make it seem as though their rites and rituals are performed today as they were when first prescribed centuries ago.{^n}{^n}According to these texts, Korvaak reigns over the Eldritch realm, a plane of existence in parallel to our own of his very making. They say that no mortal may bear witness upon its splendors and live; some fools have tried and paid the ultimate price for it. The texts warn of a many-eyed guardian that stands as a warning to all that would dare trespass upon the god's domain.{^n}{^n}Korvaak himself is said to be primordial, ancient and eternal, a progenitor of all that mankind cherishes. From his Eldritch Throne, the Korvan god ascended numerous champions to enforce his rule. He had even been known to elevate those that dare challenge his worship as a means to appease them, turning former foes into steadfast allies. The now familiar names of Rahn and Ateph came up several times in the various tales spun around Korvaak's divine actions. The history of the Korvan faith is indeed generations in the making.{^n}{^n}The Eldritch Sun is depicted both as the blessed flame and the dreadful terror of destruction. It seems he is both adored and feared by those that show him reverence, and with good reason; though Korvaak is generally depicted as benevolent to his followers, there are numerous records of disasters or outright cleansings that were attributed to the god's retribution for mortals displeasing him.{^n}{^n}Some of these events seem eerily familiar, though I cannot recall why. I suspect there are similar mythos which I have been exposed to in nearby regions. There are also a number of rituals which bear a remarkable similarity to primitive practices I have researched in the past.{^n}{^n}This leads me to wonder if there are other tribes and civilizations that have been worshiping Korvaak since antiquity, but perhaps by a different name. This is a matter which will necessitate further investigation.",

While exploring the vast collection of the Korvan City Library, I briefly escaped the attention of its stewards and found my way to a closed-off archive. Among ancient birth records of some of the most prestigious Korvan families, several ascendants included, I unearthed a collection of texts that appear to shatter some of the core tenets of the very faith that is central to these people's lives.{^n}{^n}A large number of the pages were badly damaged, as if whatever ward cast upon them had violently dissipated. Strangely, the parchment itself appeared newer than some of the records I've seen; perhaps someone had restored a damaged record at a later date. The bits that I could make out, however, painted a very different account of the early years of the Korvan faith.{^n}{^n}Korvaak himself was shown as a usurper, a conqueror of a realm he had no part in making. It is not entirely clear if the Korvaak that is spoken of today is even the same one described in those texts or whether that is the name given to the master of the Eldritch Throne.{^n}{^n}Another curiosity was the description of the upheaval involved in such a transition of power, a whirlwind of creation and destruction within which were caught the unfortunate believers. Sadly, before I could complete my analysis of the text, one of the stewards discovered my presence in the closed-off archive and promptly chased me out of the building.{^n}{^n}What little I've managed to read offers some troubling conclusions. Is Korvaak's rule destined to falter as it had before? If so, will the same destruction consume these people when it does? It is truly a shame that I could not spend more time with those texts as they represented a fantastic culmination of my research into the origins of the Korvan faith.{^n}{^n}Alas, I must prepare to leave this land and, though I have learned a great deal, I am certain there is more than a lifetime of knowledge hidden away here.

That was until the priestess Bysmiel attracted his attention. Her generous curves moved with confidence through the halls and her emerald eyes captivated the god, but it was her silky voice that got her invited to his chambers.{^n}{^n}There she stayed, sometimes for days, to the chagrin of the temple priests. Ulzuin was enthralled by the young priestess, shirking his duties and ignoring the complaints of his attendants. Nobody but Bysmiel was allowed near him and none but her would be allowed to fill his lonely nights of vigil. That lust ultimately proved to be his undoing for it was then that Ulzuin learned the true danger of mortals.{^n}{^n}It was on the fateful day when the earth ruptured and the sky turned to flame that Ulzuin realized his folly. Bysmiel had promised him a glorious surprise, an indulgence unlike any he had yet experienced in his many lifetimes, which left Ulzuin recklessly far from Korvan City and the Temple of the Eldritch Sun. Sensing the upheaval, Ulzuin rushed back to his post, but he was far too late. The city was consumed by fire and the great temple had been claimed by another.{^n}{^n}Ulzuin howled at the sky, calling out to his father, Empyrion, for aid. But the skies were silent. In blinding agony and rage, Ulzuin flattened his temple and inflicted a wound upon the world that burns to this day, just as the wound Bysmiel left upon his heart remains still.

The many-eyed fiend, the guardian of the hidden realm, clouded the minds of the temple's attendants and allowed two figures, a sorcerer and a priestess, to pass through unhindered. Together they crossed the gate to a reality beyond mortal words, the realm of the Eldritch Sun. There they found the primordial being gathering strength upon his throne.{^n}{^n}The sorcerer spared no time in unleashing his assault upon the wounded god. All the while the priestess cast her bindings upon him and the infinite gaze filled his mind with visions of terror. The celestial being thrashed against his restraints and lashed out at his attackers, and as he did so the land above crumbled and spat fire. The air filled with sulfur and the Korvan people fled for safety. The seas evaporated and rivers were replaced with molten rock, for the Korvan lands were as bound to the fate of Korvaak as flesh is to bone.{^n}{^n}For every injury the god sustained from the sorcerer's onslaught, a violent eruption shook the basin and engulfed its people; as he strained against the priestess's bindings, so the earth crumbled and changed; and as the guardian's visions consumed his very thoughts, so the Korvan people were ensnared by madness and nightmares.{^n}{^n}When at last the tremors subsided and the survivors looked up from amongst the ashes, they saw not one figure descending the temple steps in triumph, but three.

It was a perfect day; perfect weather, warm with a slight breeze coming off the river. Joined by good friends and a few skins of Elbuurk's Golden Wine, we even got good seats from a wealthy merchant who couldn't get away from some business he had to attend to. We could not believe the fortunes that smiled upon us. We were prepared for a great showing of bravery and excitement. What we saw instead was a nightmare.{^n}{^n}The first match was a simple duel between the veteran Karnath and some criminal whose name I immediately forgot. It wasn't a fight but an execution, an appetizer before the main show. In the opener, Karnath toyed with the man, tapping his sword and dodging his pathetically slow attacks. When the crowd got bored and started booing, Karnath did a quick swipe and the man's guts spilled out onto the sand. The people roared and Karnath threw his arms up in triumph, turned his back on the criminal and walked away to bask in the accolades.{^n}{^n}But that was when things took a horrifying turn. The criminal was a dead man. Nobody could have survived such a vicious blow, but instead of dropping upon his own insides, he just stood there looking at the intestines piling up in the bloody sand.{^n}{^n}After a few breaths, the man staggered forward. I figured at last the fight would be over but instead he surged forward, his guts dragging behind him, and buried his blade deep into Karnath's back. A silent gasp overcame the crowd as they witnessed the fall of their favored champion, but he too did not stagger from the lethal blow. Karnath simply looked at the blade erupting from his chest, spat up a mouthful of blood and pulled himself free of it. He turned slowly towards his would-be killer.{^n}{^n}In a rage, Karnath struck out and, with a mighty clash of steel, knocked the blade from the criminal's hand. With the backswing, he cut the man's arm clean off at the elbow. The now delimbed criminal stumbled backward to recover his weapon, but Karnath had other ideas. The gladiator stamped a mailed boot down on a bundle of sand-covered bloody flesh that snaked its way from his opponent. With a heave, he pulled the criminal back towards him and proceeded with a series of cruel attacks that could only be described as butchery.{^n}{^n}The crowd watched in silence, horror and awe frozen on their faces, as Karnath delimbed the man, who screamed all the while for mercy, but he would not die. His blood had long stopped pumping, but still he would not die.{^n}{^n}Exhausted and confused, Karnath stepped back from his bloody work. The criminal, now just the remnants of a torso and a head, gasped and screamed. The gladiator scowled and walked out of the arena towards the barracks with a dark purpose upon the blood-drenched sword still clenched in his hand.{^n}{^n}The crowd remained for some time, stunned by what they had witnessed. Nobody came to help the butchered man who still clung to life at the center of the arena. Though not a word was spoken, our minds were as one: we all feared whatever malady had struck him so would befall us too should we get too close.{^n}{^n}How wrong were we to think that.
